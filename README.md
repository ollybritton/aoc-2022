# AoC 2022
Here are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022). They're not the most efficient or elegant but I'm just hoping to do as many as I can. [Last year](https://github.com/ollybritton/advent-2021) I overcomplicated it so this year I'm just using Python notebooks for quick iterations and feedback, loosely inspired by [Peter Norvig's approach](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/blob/main/ipynb/Advent-2018.ipynb).
